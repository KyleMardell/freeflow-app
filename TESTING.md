# Free Flow - Freelance Project Tracker Testing


![Responsive Image](/docmedia/design/responsive.png)


Free Flow is a freelance project tracker web app designed for business owners who need to manage projects and their associated tasks.
The app helps track a project's progress while calculating estimated or final time and cost. Free Flow aims to assist anyone working on a new project, or even to estimate a project's cost and timeline before beginning. The tool is designed to solve the challenge of understanding project scope in terms of time and cost, offering value to any business person managing projects of various kinds.
One of Free Flow's standout features is the ability to create custom tasks. These custom tasks can be used as templates across multiple projects, and when marked as completed, they automatically update key data such as average time taken, longest and shortest completion times, and number of uses. This feature enables users to track how long specific tasks take over time and improve future project estimates.
For instance, a builder could use Free Flow to estimate and monitor the progress of a construction project, a graphic designer might leverage it for estimating the scope and costs of a branding project, or a web developer could use it to track the expenses of developing a website.
Ultimately, Free Flow allows users to track multiple projects by breaking each one down into manageable tasks, regardless of the project type.
